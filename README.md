# MVVM Example Project

This is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that demonstrates the implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. The project showcases best practices in iOS development using SwiftUI and modern Swift features.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean MVVM architecture with the following directory structure:

```
MVVMEXAMPLE/
├── Models/           # Data models and business logic
├── View Models/      # ViewModels that handle the presentation logic
├── Services/         # Network and data services
├── Assets.xcassets/  # Project assets and resources
├── ContentView.swift # Main view of the application
└── MVVMEXAMPLEApp.swift # App entry point
```

## Architecture Overview

### MVVM Pattern Implementation

- **Models**: Contains the data models and business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views that handle the UI representation
- **ViewModels**: Manages the presentation logic and state for the views
- **Services**: Handles data operations, networking, and other services

## Features

- Clean MVVM architecture implementation
- SwiftUI-based user interface
- Separation of concerns
- Reactive data binding
- Modern Swift features

## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `MVVMEXAMPLE.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

## Project Organization

### Models
Contains the data models that represent the core business logic of the application.

### View Models
Contains the ViewModels that manage the presentation logic and state for the views.

### Services
Contains service classes that handle data operations, networking, and other external interactions.

### Views
The SwiftUI views that compose the user interface of the application.

## Best Practices

This project follows several iOS development best practices:

- Clean Architecture principles
- SOLID principles
- SwiftUI best practices
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reactive programming patterns
